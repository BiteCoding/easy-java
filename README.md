# easy-java
This repository contains all my  projects, made outside of school, that use a special library "basisSwing130203UTF8".

The library handles most of the gui. You need this library if you want to run one of the projects

The library is implemented in this repository.
Add it to your dependencies and enjoy my little brainchilds :)
